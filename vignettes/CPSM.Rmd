# Introduction
The CPSM  is a R-package for a computational pipeline for the predicting the 
Survival Probability of Cancer Patients. It performs various steps: Data 
Processing, Split data into training and test subset, Data Normalization, 
Select Significant features based on Univariate survival, Generate LASSO PI 
Score, Develop Prediction model for survival probability based on different 
features and draw survival curve based on predicted survival probability values 
and barplots for predicted mean and median survival time of patients.


# Installation 
To install this package, start R (version "4.4") and enter the code provided:
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("CPSM")
```


# Input Data
Example Input data: "Example_TCGA_LGG_FPKM_data" is a tab separated data.  It 
contains Samples (184 LGG Cancer Samples) in the rows and Features in the 
columns. Gene Expression is available in terms of FPKM values in the data.
Features information: In the data there are 11 clinical + demographic, 4 types 
survival with time and event information  and 19,978 protein coding genes.
Clinical and demographic features: Clinical demographic features that are 
present in this example data include Age,  subtype,  gender,  race,  
ajcc_pathologic_tumor_stage,  histological_type, histological_grade,  
treatment_outcome_first_course, radiation_treatment_adjuvant,  sample_type,  
type. Types of Survival: 4 types of Survival include OS (overall survival), PFS 
(progression-free survival), DSS (disease-specific survival), DFS (Disease-free 
survival). In the data, column names OS, PFS, DSS and DFS represent event 
information, while  OS.time, PFS.time, DSS.time and DFS.time indicate survival 
time in days.

```{r , warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(CPSM)
library(SummarizedExperiment)
set.seed(7) # set seed
data(Example_TCGA_LGG_FPKM_data, package = "CPSM")
Example_TCGA_LGG_FPKM_data
```

# Step 1- Data Processing 
This function converts OS time (in days) into months and then removes samples 
where OS/OS.time information is missing.
Here, we need to provide input data in tsv format. Further, we needs 
to define col_num (column number at which clinical/demographic and survival 
information ends,e.g. 20,  surv_time (name of column which contain survival 
time (in days) information, e.g. OS.time ) and output, e.g. “New_data”.

```{r }
data(Example_TCGA_LGG_FPKM_data, package = "CPSM")
combined_df <- cbind(as.data.frame(colData(Example_TCGA_LGG_FPKM_data))
                      [, -ncol(colData(Example_TCGA_LGG_FPKM_data))],  
                     t(as.data.frame(assay(Example_TCGA_LGG_FPKM_data, 
                                           "expression"))))  
New_data <- data_process_f(combined_df, col_num = 20, surv_time = "OS.time")
str(New_data[1:10])
```

After data processing, we got a new output “New_data”, which contains 176 
samples. Thus, data_process_f function removes 8 samples where OS/OS time 
information is missing. Besides, here is a new 21st column in the data with  
column name “OS_month”  where OS time is available in months.


# Step 2 - Split Data into Training and Test Subset
Before proceeding further, we need to split our data into training and test 
subset for the purpose of feature selection and model development. Here, we 
need output from the previous step as an input ( which was “New_data”). 
Next we need to define the fraction (e.g. 0.9) by which we want to split data 
into training and test. Thus, fraction=0.9 will split data into 90% training 
and 10% as test set. Besides, we also need to provide training and set output 
names (e.g. train_FPKM,test_FPKM )


```{r}
data(New_data, package = "CPSM")
# Call the function
result <- tr_test_f(data = New_data, fraction = 0.9)
# Access the train and test data
train_FPKM <- result$train_data
str(train_FPKM[1:10])
test_FPKM <- result$test_data
str(test_FPKM[1:10])
```

After the train-test split, we got a two new outputs:“train_FPKM”, “test_FPKM”, 
where, train_FPKM contains 158 samples and test_FPKM contains 18 samples. 
Thus, tr_test_f function splits data into 90:10 ratio. 

# Step 3 - Data Normalization
Next to select features and develop ML models, data must be normalized. Since, 
expression is available in terms of FPKM values. Thus,  
`train_test_normalization_f` function will first convert FPKM value into log 
scale [log2(FPKM+1) followed by quantile normalization using the 
“preprocessCore” package. Here, training data will be used as a target matrix 
for quantile normalization.  Here, we need to provide training and test 
datasets (that we obtained from the  previous step of Train/Test Split). 
Further, we need to provide column number where clinical information ends 
(e.g. 21) in the input datasets. Besides, we also need to provide output 
names (train_clin_data (which contains only Clinical information of training 
data), test_clin_data (which contains only Clinical information of training 
data), train_Normalized_data_clin_data (which contains Clinical information and 
normalized values of genes of training samples), test_Normalized_data_clin_data 
(which contains Clinical information and normalized values of genes of test 
samples).


```{r }
# Step 3 - Data Normalization
# Normalize the training and test data sets
data(train_FPKM, package = "CPSM")
data(test_FPKM, package = "CPSM")
Result_N_data <- train_test_normalization_f(
  train_data = train_FPKM,
  test_data = test_FPKM,
  col_num = 21
)
# Access the Normalized train and test data
Train_Clin <- Result_N_data$Train_Clin
Test_Clin <- Result_N_data$Test_Clin
Train_Norm_data <- Result_N_data$Train_Norm_data
Test_Norm_data <- Result_N_data$Test_Norm_data
str(Train_Clin[1:10])
str(Train_Norm_data[1:10])
```

After, running the function, we obtained 4 outputs: Train_Clin - Contains only 
Clinical features, Test_Clin - contains only Clinical features of Test 
samples; Train_Norm_data - Clinical features with normalized values of genes 
for training samples; Test_Norm_data - Clinical features with normalized 
values of genes for test samples.


# Step 4a - Prognostic Index (PI)  Score Calculation
Next to create a survival model, we  will  create a Prognostic Index (PI)  
Score. PI score is calculated based on the expression of the features selected 
by the LASSO regression model and their beta coefficients. For instance, 5 
features  (G1, G2, G3, G4, and G5 and their coefficient values are B1, B2, 
B3, B4, and B5, respectively) selected by the LASSO method. Then PI score will 
be computed as following:

PI score  = G1*B1 + G2*B2 + G3 * B3 + G4*B4+ G5*B5

Here, we need to provide Normalized training (Train_Norm_data) and test data 
(Test_Norm_data)as input data that we have obtained from the previous function 
“train_test_normalization_f”. Further, we need to provide col_num n column 
number at which clinical features ends (e.g. 21), nfolds  (number of folds  
e.g. 5) for the LASSO regression method to select features. We implemented 
LASSO using the “glmnet” package.  Further, we need to provide surv_time (name 
of column containing survival time in months, e.g. OS_month) and surv_event 
(name of column containing survival event information, e.g. OS) information in 
the data. Besides, we also need to provide names and training and test outputs to store data containing LASSO genes and PI values.


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=4 }
# Step 4 - Lasso PI Score
data(Train_Norm_data, package = "CPSM")
data(Test_Norm_data, package = "CPSM")
Result_PI <- Lasso_PI_scores_f(
  train_data = Train_Norm_data,
  test_data = Test_Norm_data,
  nfolds = 5,
  col_num = 21,
  surv_time = "OS_month",
  surv_event = "OS"
)
Train_Lasso_key_variables <- Result_PI$Train_Lasso_key_variables
Train_PI_data <- Result_PI$Train_PI_data
Test_PI_data <- Result_PI$Test_PI_data
str(Train_PI_data[1:10])
str(Test_PI_data[1:10])
plot(Result_PI$cvfit)
```

Thus, Lasso_PI_scores_f gave us following outputs:
1. Train_Lasso_key_variables: List of features selected by LASSO and their beta 
coefficient values
2. Train_Cox_Lasso_Regression_lamda_plot: Lasso Regression Lambda plot.
3. Train_PI_data: It contains expression of genes selected by LASSO and PI 
score in the last column for training samples.
4. Test_PI_data: It contains expression of genes selected by LASSO and PI score 
in the last column for test samples.


# Step 4b - Univariate  Survival Significant Feature Selection
Besides PI score, with the “Univariate_sig_features_f” function of CPSM 
package, we can select significant (p-value <0.05) features based on 
univariate survival analysis. These features are selected based on their 
capability to stratify high-risk and low-risk survival groups using the cut 
off value of their median expression.  
Here, we need to provide Normalized training (Train_Norm_data) and test 
data (Test_Norm_data)as input data that we have obtained from the previous 
function “train_test_normalization_f”. Further, we need to provide a “col_num” 
(e.g 21)column number at which clinical features ends. Further, we need to 
provide surv_time (name of column containing survival time in months, e.g. 
OS_month) and surv_event (name of column containing survival event information, 
e.g. OS) information in the data. Besides, we also need to provide names and 
training and test output to store data containing expression of 
selected genes.


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE }
# Step 4b - Univariate  Survival Significant Feature Selection.
data(Train_Norm_data, package = "CPSM")
data(Test_Norm_data, package = "CPSM")
Result_Uni <- Univariate_sig_features_f(
  train_data = Train_Norm_data,
  test_data = Test_Norm_data,
  col_num = 21,
  surv_time = "OS_month",
  surv_event = "OS"
)
Univariate_Suv_Sig_G_L <- Result_Uni$Univariate_Survival_Significant_genes_List
Train_Uni_sig_data <- Result_Uni$Train_Uni_sig_data
Test_Uni_sig_data <- Result_Uni$Test_Uni_sig_data
Uni_Sur_Sig_clin_List <- Result_Uni$Univariate_Survival_Significant_clin_List
Train_Uni_sig_clin_data <- Result_Uni$Train_Uni_sig_clin_data
Test_Uni_sig_clin_data <- Result_Uni$Test_Uni_sig_clin_data
str(Univariate_Suv_Sig_G_L[1:10])
```

Thus, Univariate_sig_features_f  gave us following outputs:
Univariate_Suv_Sig_G_L: a table of univariate significant genes along with 
their corresponding coefficient values, HR value, P-values, C-Index values.
Train_Uni_sig_data: It contains expression of significant genes selected by 
univariate survival analysis for training samples.
Test_Uni_sig_data: It contains expression of significant genes selected by 
univariate survival analysis for test samples.

# Step 5 - Prediction model development for survival probability of patients
After selecting significant or key features using LASSO or Univariate survival 
analysis, next we want to develop an ML prediction model to predict survival 
probability of patients. MTLR_pred_model_f function of CPSM give us multiple 
options to develop models including Only Clinical features (Model_type=1), PI 
score (Model_type=2), PI Score + Clinical features (Model_type=3), Significant 
Univariate features (Model_type=4), Significant Univariate features Clinical 
features (Model_type=5) using MTLR package. Further, here, we were interested 
in developing a model based on PI score. Thus, we need to provide following 
inputs: (1) Training data with only clinical features, (2) Test data with only 
clinical features, (3) Model type (e.g. 2, since we want to develop model based 
on PI score), (4) Training data with PI score , (5) Test data with PI score, 
(6) Clin_Feature_List (e.g. Key_PI_list), a list of features which will be  
used to build model . Furthermore, we also need to provide surv_time (name of 
column containing survival time in months, e.g. OS_month) and surv_event (name 
of column containing survival event information, e.g. OS) information in the 
clinical data

## Model for only Clinical features
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, error = TRUE }
data(Train_Clin, package = "CPSM")
data(Test_Clin, package = "CPSM")
data(Key_Clin_feature_list, package = "CPSM")
Result_Model_Type1 <- MTLR_pred_model_f(
  train_clin_data = Train_Clin,
  test_clin_data = Test_Clin,
  Model_type = 1,
  train_features_data = Train_Clin,
  test_features_data = Test_Clin,
  Clin_Feature_List = Key_Clin_feature_list,
  surv_time = "OS_month",
  surv_event = "OS"
)
survCurves_data <- Result_Model_Type1$survCurves_data
mean_median_survival_tim_d <- Result_Model_Type1$mean_median_survival_time_data
survival_result_bas_on_MTLR <- Result_Model_Type1$survival_result_based_on_MTLR
Error_mat_for_Model <- Result_Model_Type1$Error_mat_for_Model
```


## Model for PI
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, error = TRUE}
data(Train_Clin, package = "CPSM")
data(Test_Clin, package = "CPSM")
data(Train_PI_data, package = "CPSM")
data(Test_PI_data, package = "CPSM")
data(Key_PI_list, package = "CPSM")
Result_Model_Type2 <- MTLR_pred_model_f(
  train_clin_data = Train_Clin,
  test_clin_data = Test_Clin,
  Model_type = 2,
  train_features_data = Train_PI_data,
  test_features_data = Test_PI_data,
  Clin_Feature_List = Key_PI_list,
  surv_time = "OS_month",
  surv_event = "OS"
)
survCurves_data <- Result_Model_Type2$survCurves_data
mean_median_surviv_tim_da <- Result_Model_Type2$mean_median_survival_time_data
survival_result_b_on_MTLR <- Result_Model_Type2$survival_result_based_on_MTLR
Error_mat_for_Model <- Result_Model_Type2$Error_mat_for_Model
```


## Model for Clinical features + PI
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, error = TRUE}
data(Train_Clin, package = "CPSM")
data(Test_Clin, package = "CPSM")
data(Train_PI_data, package = "CPSM")
data(Test_PI_data, package = "CPSM")
data(Key_Clin_features_with_PI_list, package = "CPSM")
Result_Model_Type3 <- MTLR_pred_model_f(
  train_clin_data = Train_Clin,
  test_clin_data = Test_Clin,
  Model_type = 3,
  train_features_data = Train_PI_data,
  test_features_data = Test_PI_data,
  Clin_Feature_List = Key_Clin_features_with_PI_list,
  surv_time = "OS_month",
  surv_event = "OS"
)
survCurves_data <- Result_Model_Type3$survCurves_data
mean_median_surv_tim_da <- Result_Model_Type3$mean_median_survival_time_data
survival_result_b_on_MTLR <- Result_Model_Type3$survival_result_based_on_MTLR
Error_mat_for_Model <- Result_Model_Type3$Error_mat_for_Model
```


## Model for Univariate + Clinical features
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, error = TRUE}
data(Train_Clin, package = "CPSM")
data(Test_Clin, package = "CPSM")
data(Train_Uni_sig_data, package = "CPSM")
data(Test_Uni_sig_data, package = "CPSM")
data(Key_univariate_features_with_Clin_list, package = "CPSM")
Result_Model_Type5 <- MTLR_pred_model_f(
  train_clin_data = Train_Clin,
  test_clin_data = Test_Clin,
  Model_type = 4,
  train_features_data = Train_Uni_sig_data,
  test_features_data = Test_Uni_sig_data,
  Clin_Feature_List = Key_univariate_features_with_Clin_list,
  surv_time = "OS_month",
  surv_event = "OS"
)
survCurves_data <- Result_Model_Type5$survCurves_data
mean_median_surv_tim_da <- Result_Model_Type5$mean_median_survival_time_data
survival_result_b_on_MTLR <- Result_Model_Type5$survival_result_based_on_MTLR
Error_mat_for_Model <- Result_Model_Type5$Error_mat_for_Model
```

After, implementing MTLR_pred_model_f function , we got following outputs:
1. Model_with_PI.RData : Model on training data
2. survCurves_data : Table containing predicted survival probability of each 
patient at different time points. This data can be further used to plot the 
survival curve of patients.
3. mean_median_survival_time_data : Table containing predicted mean and median 
survival time  of each patient in the test data. This data can be further used 
for bar plots.
4. Error_mat_for_Model : Table containing performance parameters obtained on 
test data based on prediction model. It contains IBS score (Integrated Brier 
Score) =0.192, C-Index =0.81.


# Step 6 - Survival curves/plots for individual patient
Next to visualize survival of patients, we will plot survival curve plots using 
the surv_curve_plots_f function  based on the data “survCurves_data ” that we 
obtained from the previous step after running the  MTLR_pred_model_f function. 
Further,  the surv_curve_plots_f function also allows highlighting a specific 
patient on the curve. Thus the function  needs only two inputs: 1) 
Surv_curve_data, (2) Sample ID of a specific patient (e.g. TCGA-TQ-A8XE-01) 
that needs to be highlighted.


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, error = TRUE , fig.width=7, fig.height=4}
# Create Survival curves/plots for individual patients
data(survCurves_data, package = "CPSM")
plots <- surv_curve_plots_f(
  Surv_curve_data = survCurves_data,
  selected_sample = "TCGA-TQ-A7RQ-01"
)
# Print the plots
print(plots$all_patients_plot)
print(plots$highlighted_patient_plot)
```

Here, we obtained two output plots:
1. Survival curves for all patients in the test data with different colors 
2. Survival curves for all patients (in black) and highlighted patient (yellow) 
in the test data 


# Step 7 - Predicted mean and median survival time of individual patients 

Next to visualize predicted survival time of patients, we will plot barplot 
for mean/median using “mean_median_surv_barplot_f” function based on the data 
that we obtained from step 5 after running the  MTLR_pred_model_f function. 
Further, the mean_median_surv_barplot_f function also allows highlighting a 
specific patient on the curve. Thus the function  needs only two inputs: 1) 
surv_mean_med_data, (2) Sample ID of a specific patient 
(e.g. TCGA-TQ-A8XE-01) that needs to be highlighted.


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, error = TRUE , fig.width=7, fig.height=4}
data(mean_median_survival_time_data, package = "CPSM")
plots_2 <- mean_median_surv_barplot_f(
  surv_mean_med_data =
    mean_median_survival_time_data,
  selected_sample = "TCGA-TQ-A7RQ-01"
)
# Print the plots
print(plots_2$mean_med_all_pat)
print(plots_2$highlighted_selected_pat)
```

Here, we obtained two output plots:
1. Barplot for all patients in the test data, where the red color bar 
represents mean survival and cyan/green color bar represents median survival 
time. 
2. Barplot for all patients with a highlighted patient (dashed black outline) 
in the test data. It shows  this patient has a predicted mean and median 
survival is 81.58 and 75.50 months.


# Step 8 - Nomogram based on Key features
Next, the Nomogram_generate_f function of CPSM  also provides an option to 
generate a nomogram plot based on user defined clinical and other features in 
the data. For instance, we will generate a nomogram based on 6 features (Age, 
gender, race, histological_type, sample_type, PI). Here, we will provide data 
containing all the features (Samples in rows and features in columns) (e.g. 
Train_Data_Nomogram_input) and a list of features (feature_list_for_Nomogram) 
based on which we want to generate a nomogram.  Further, we also need to 
provide surv_time (name of column containing survival time in months, e.g. 
OS_month) and surv_event (name of column containing survival event information, 
e.g. OS) information in the data.


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, error = TRUE, fig.width=7, fig.height=6 }
data(Train_Data_Nomogram_input, package = "CPSM")
data(feature_list_for_Nomogram, package = "CPSM")
Result_Nomogram <- Nomogram_generate_f(
  data = Train_Data_Nomogram_input,
  Feature_List = feature_list_for_Nomogram,
  surv_time = "OS_month",
  surv_event = "OS"
)
C_index_mat <- Result_Nomogram$C_index_mat
```

Here, we will get a Nomogram based on features that we provide. This nomogram 
can predict Risk (Event risk, eg, Death), 1-year, 3-year, 5-year and 10 years 
survival of patients.

# SessionInfo

As last part of this document, we call the function "sessionInfo()", 
which reports the version numbers of R and all the packages used 
in this session. It is good practice to always keep such a record 
as it will help to trace down what has happened in case that an R 
script ceases to work because the functions have been changed in 
a newer version of a package.


```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
