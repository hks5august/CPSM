Description: The CPSM package provides a comprehensive computational pipeline 
             for predicting the survival probability of cancer patients. It 
             offers a series of steps including data processing, splitting 
             data into training and test subsets, and normalization of data. 
             The package enables the selection of significant features based on 
             univariate survival analysis and generates a LASSO prognostic 
             index score. It supports the development of predictive models for 
             survival probability using various features and provides 
             visualization tools to draw survival curves based on predicted 
             survival probabilities. Additionally, SPM includes functionalities 
             for generating bar plots that depict the predicted mean and median 
             survival times of patients, making it a versatile tool for 
             survival analysis in cancer research.
