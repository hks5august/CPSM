Description: CPSM provides a comprehensive computational pipeline for predicting
    survival probability and risk groups in cancer patients. The package includes
    steps for data preprocessing, training/test split, and normalization. It enables
    feature selection using univariate survival analysis and computes a LASSO-based
    prognostic index (PI) score. CPSM supports the development of predictive models
    using various feature sets and offers a suite of visualization tools, including
    survival curves based on predicted probabilities, barplots for predicted mean
    and median survival times, KM plots overlaid with individual survival predictions,
    and nomograms for estimating 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year survival probabilities.
    This makes CPSM a versatile tool for survival analysis in cancer research.
